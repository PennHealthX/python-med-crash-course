    "## What is Coding?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of coding like giving instructions to a very literal friend. When you tell a friend to \"make a sandwich,\" they understand all the implied steps because they have common sense and life experience. A computer, however, needs every single step spelled out explicitly:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get two slices of bread\n",
    "2. Open the peanut butter jar\n",
    "3. Use a knife to spread peanut butter on one slice\n",
    "4. And so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coding** (also called programming) is the process of writing these step-by-step instructions in a language that computers can understand. Just like humans speak different languages (English, Spanish, Mandarin), computers have programming languages. Python is one of the most popular and beginner-friendly programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was designed to be readable and straightforward. Compare these two ways of saying the same thing:\n",
    "\n",
    "**In plain English:** \"Print the words 'Hello, World!' to the screen\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Python:** `print(\"Hello, World!\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "See? It's almost like English! This is why Python is perfect for beginners."

    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Definition:** A variable is a named container that stores a value. It lets you save data, use it later, and change it whenever you need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simpler terms:** Think of a variable like a labeled box. You pick a name for the box (like \"age\" or \"patient_name\"), and you can put something inside it. Later, whenever you use that name, the computer knows to look inside that box and grab whatever you stored there. You can also swap out what's in the box whenever you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you remember algebra,** you're already familiar with variables! In math, you write things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = 5$$\n",
    "$$y = x + 3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming variables work the same way—`x` holds a value, and you can use it in expressions. The difference is that programming variables can hold more than just numbers: they can store text, true/false values, lists, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need variables?** Without variables, you'd have to re-type the same information over and over. Imagine writing a program that uses a patient's name 50 times—if their name changes, you'd have to update it in 50 places! With a variable, you store the name once and use the variable everywhere. Change it in one place, and it updates everywhere automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Can Variables Store?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can hold different **types** of data. Here are the basic (primitive) types in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Strings - text wrapped in quotes\n",
    "name = \"Cornelius Pumpernickel\"\n",
    "diagnosis = 'involuntary movement disorder'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Integers - whole numbers (no decimals)\n",
    "age = 21\n",
    "num_teslas_crashed = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Floats - decimal numbers\n",
    "temperature = 98.6\n",
    "height_in_meters = 1.75\n",
    "\n",
    "# Booleans - True or False values only\n",
    "is_insecure_about_ping_pong = True\n",
    "concerned_about_diarrhea = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important: `=` Means Assignment, NOT Equality!\n",
    "\n",
    "In math class, `=` means \"is equal to.\" In Python, **the single equals sign `=` means \"assign\" or \"put this value into this variable.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 21\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You're NOT saying \"age is equal to 21\" like a math equation. You're saying **\"take the value 21 and store it in a box called age.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as an arrow pointing left: `age <- 21` (put 21 into age).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why you can do things that would be mathematically impossible:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "x = x + 1  # This takes the current value of x (5), adds 1, and stores 6 back into x\n",
    "print(x)   # Outputs: 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In math, `x = x + 1` makes no sense. But in programming, it just means \"update x to be one more than it was before.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** If you want to *check* if two things are equal (like in math), Python uses double equals: `==`. We'll cover this later!"

    "\n",
    "Auditory-Triggered Involuntary Upper Extremity Dyskinesia (ATIUED), colloquially referred to as \"Six-Seven Syndrome,\" is a rare neurological condition characterized by uncontrollable bilateral arm movements following exposure to specific numerical auditory stimuli. Despite increasing case reports, no standardized classification system has existed—until now.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "A multicenter retrospective cohort study (n=847) was conducted across 23 tertiary care facilities. Episode duration was measured from onset of motor symptoms to complete cessation of involuntary movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results & Classification Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our findings, we propose the following diagnostic criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Classification | Episode Duration | Clinical Significance |\n",
    "|----------------|------------------|----------------------|\n",
    "| **Acute** | < 10 seconds | Mild; minimal functional impairment. Often self-resolves. |\n",
    "| **Intermediate** | 10–20 seconds | Moderate; noticeable social and occupational disruption. Pharmacological intervention may be considered. |\n",
    "| **Chronic** | > 20 seconds | Severe; substantial impairment to daily functioning. Multidisciplinary management recommended. |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients presenting with episode durations exceeding 20 seconds should be classified as **chronic** and warrant aggressive intervention. Our classification system provides a standardized framework for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment allocation.\n",

    "\n",
    "You need to classify his condition first. Based on the *Nature* article, you know the classification depends on the episode duration—but you can't just eyeball it. You need to write code that checks the duration and tells you which category the patient falls into.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **if statements** come in. An if statement lets your program make decisions: *\"If this condition is true, do this. Otherwise, do something else.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "## If Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Definition:** An if statement is a control structure that executes a block of code only when a specified condition evaluates to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simpler terms:** It's how you teach a computer to make decisions. Just like you might think, \"If it's raining, I'll bring an umbrella\"—your code can think, \"If the duration is less than 10, print 'Acute'.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # code to run if condition is True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important things to notice:**\n",
    "- The condition is followed by a colon `:`\n",
    "- The code inside the if statement is **indented** (usually 4 spaces). This indentation tells Python which code belongs to the if statement.\n",
    "- The condition must evaluate to `True` or `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding More Branches: `elif` and `else`\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you have multiple conditions to check? Use `elif` (short for \"else if\") and `else`:\n",
    "\n",

    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # runs if condition1 is True\n",

    "    # runs if condition1 is False AND condition2 is True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # runs if ALL above conditions are False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how we said `=` means assignment, not equality? Here's where that matters. To *compare* values, use these operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator | Meaning | Example |\n",
    "|----------|---------|---------|\n",
    "| `==` | equal to | `x == 5` |\n",
    "| `!=` | not equal to | `x != 5` |\n",
    "| `<` | less than | `x < 10` |\n",
    "| `>` | greater than | `x > 10` |\n",
    "| `<=` | less than or equal to | `x <= 10` |\n",
    "| `>=` | greater than or equal to | `x >= 10` |\n",
    "\n",

    "You've just finished classifying Cornelius when a nurse bursts through the door.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Doc, we've got a problem. Seventeen more patients just arrived—all from SkibidiFest 2699. They're all showing symptoms.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Seventeen patients. Each one needs to be classified based on their episode duration. Are you going to copy and paste your if/elif/else code seventeen times? What if the classification criteria change—are you going to update it in seventeen different places?\n",
    "\n",
    "There has to be a better way. And there is: **functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Definition:** A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It can take inputs (called parameters), process them, and return an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simpler terms:** A function is like a recipe. Instead of writing out the full instructions every time you want to make a dish, you write the recipe once and just say \"make the dish\" whenever you need it. You give it ingredients (inputs), it follows the steps, and it gives you the finished product (output).\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you've taken math classes,** this might feel familiar. In math, you write functions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = x^2 + 3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You give it an input (x = 2), it does some work, and returns an output (f(2) = 7). Programming functions work the same way:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Math | Python |\n",
    "|------|--------|\n",
    "| $f(x) = x² + 3$ | `def f(x): return x**2 + 3` |\n",
    "| $f(2) = 7$ | `f(2)` returns `7` |\n",
    "| Input: $x$ | Input: parameter |\n",
    "| Output: $f(x)$ | Output: return value |\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference? Programming functions can do much more than math—they can work with text, make decisions, process lists, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need functions?**\n",
    "- **Reusability:** Write code once, use it many times\n",
    "- **Organization:** Break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces\n",
    "- **Maintainability:** If you need to change something, you only change it in one place\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Function Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameter1, parameter2...):\n",
    "    # code that does something\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key parts:**\n",
    "- `def` tells Python you're defining a function\n",
    "- `function_name` is what you'll call to use the function (pick something descriptive!)\n",
    "- Parameters (in parentheses) are the inputs the function expects\n",
    "- The `return` statement sends a value back to wherever the function was called\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: A Simple Greeting Function\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    message = \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\"\n",
    "    return message\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the function\n",
    "result = greet(\"Cornelius\")\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: Hello, Cornelius!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use it again with a different input\n",
    "print(greet(\"Dr. Smith\"))  # Output: Hello, Dr. Smith!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task\n",
