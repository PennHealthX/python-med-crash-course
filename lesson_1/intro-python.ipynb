    "## What is Coding?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of coding like giving instructions to a very literal friend. When you tell a friend to \"make a sandwich,\" they understand all the implied steps because they have common sense and life experience. A computer, however, needs every single step spelled out explicitly:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get two slices of bread\n",
    "2. Open the peanut butter jar\n",
    "3. Use a knife to spread peanut butter on one slice\n",
    "4. And so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coding** (also called programming) is the process of writing these step-by-step instructions in a language that computers can understand. Just like humans speak different languages (English, Spanish, Mandarin), computers have programming languages. Python is one of the most popular and beginner-friendly programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was designed to be readable and straightforward. Compare these two ways of saying the same thing:\n",
    "\n",
    "**In plain English:** \"Print the words 'Hello, World!' to the screen\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Python:** `print(\"Hello, World!\")`\n",
    "\n",
