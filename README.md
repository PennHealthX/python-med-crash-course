# A Medical Student's Crash Course to Python and Machine Learning

**Faculty Advisor**: Daniel Hashimoto

**Student Course Leadership**: Aaron Hsieh and Freya Gulamali

Welcome! This course covers the fundamentals of Python and machine learning. While not comprehensive, it will give you the foundation to explore and dive deeper on your own.

## Logistics

To make this accessible to all students, we will use Colab for the majority of this workshop series. However, if possible, we encourage you to go through the coding lessons locally on your laptop. If you are interested in using Python and machine learning for your research, it is likely you cannot publish patient data onto Colab. You will have to run your code on your own device. We will go through this set up in a future lesson and will provide guides.
