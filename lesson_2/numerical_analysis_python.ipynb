    "# Introduction to Numerical Analysis with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to numerical analysis! In health research and data science, you'll often work with large datasets, perform statistical analyses, and create visualizations. Python has three essential libraries that make this work incredibly powerful:\n",
    "\n",
    "**NumPy (Numerical Python)**\n",
    "- Fast mathematical operations on large arrays and matrices\n",
    "- Think: efficiently processing thousands of patient measurements at once\n",
    "- Used for: numerical computing, linear algebra, statistical calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pandas (Panel Data)**\n",
    "- Works with structured data (like spreadsheets and databases)\n",
    "- Think: organizing and analyzing patient records, clinical trial data\n",
    "- Used for: data cleaning, filtering, grouping, and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matplotlib**\n",
    "- Creates publication-quality graphs and visualizations\n",
    "- Think: plotting trends, distributions, and research findings\n",
    "- Used for: charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why These Matter in Health Research\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have data from 10,000 patients. With these tools, you can:\n",
    "- Calculate statistics across all patients in milliseconds (NumPy)\n",
    "- Filter patients by age, condition, or treatment group (Pandas)\n",
    "- Visualize treatment outcomes and identify trends (Matplotlib)\n",
    "\n",
    "These libraries work together seamlessly and are the foundation of data science in Python. Let's learn how to use them!\n",

    "## Using External Code: Import Statements\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why Use Imports?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of modules like apps on your phone. Your phone has basic features, but you download apps to do specific things (social media, games, navigation). Similarly, Python has basic features, but you import modules to do specialized tasks like:\n",
    "\n",
